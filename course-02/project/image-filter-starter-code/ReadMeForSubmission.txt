READ ME:

I have cloned your Cloud Developer repository, created my dev branch, pushed my changes and created a pull request.
Here is the pull request url for github: https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/pull/147

I mainly changed server.ts file to add a get method to filter an image.
I added my elasticbeanstalk deployment screen and postman test result screen.

My elasticbeanstalk endpoint url is : http://image-filter-starter-code-dev2222222222.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Note:Your test jpeg file does not exist on internet anymore:
